## Java GUI Crud

Welcome to this simple project.

GUI Crud is an attempt of practicing simple Java concepts with Database connections to create a simple CRUD visual application.

This app will employ visual elements such as windows, buttons and text fields and implement the 4 CRUD operations, namely, Create, Read, Update and Delete.

Recent Java features - such as lambdas and records - will be employed as much as possible.

JDK version: 21.0.1
MySQL version: 8.0.37
